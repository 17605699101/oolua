1.2.2
*1.2.1 is skipped due to packaging error with 1.2.0
*Converted premake scripts to premake4 (Xcode error when linking gmock needs fixing)
*optimised checking of a type against a requested type via casting and storing a function taking the parameters to 
lua_Cfunction which requires less usage of the Lua stack. 
*moved Luna licence to a more suitable section of code
*removed dead code from oolua_storage.h
*removed dead code from class_from_stack.h
*added setting a user data's none const name whilst changing it's constant status in set_type_top_to_none_const to 
prevent potentail errors. As the name and none constant name use a pointer compare when checking for constant status.
