Additionaly for Unit Tests or use of Test Unit Scripts
http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/cppunit/

= Compile_Scripts =
Two type of scripts are present test unit scripts and build scripts.
Test Unit Scripts:
Naming is of the format 
{{{
[make or IDE]_tests.[sh or bat]
}}}
when run in the root directory these will produce compiler and test unit result output saved to disk located in a directory create named "build_logs". These scripts clean up any other files produced during there running.

= Build_Scripts =
Naming is of the format
{{{
[make of IDE]_build.[sh or bat]
}}}
when run in the root directory it compiles the library debug and release versions. These static libraries can be found in the "local_install" directory along with copies of the header files in a directory below this named "oolua". All otherfiles created during the running are deleted.
 

= Building Makefiles or IDE projects =
OOLUA's source and header files can added to your project or be compiled as a static library.
To compile as a static library or to run the UnitTests, Premake version 4 is the recommended method to generate make files/IDE projects. This can either be accomplish using the following details or using the pre-existing bash or bat files( see Compile_Scripts).
