= Introduction =
Most of [Building] is relevant for 1.3, the differences are listed below.

= Scripts =
Build and test scripts have been moved to build_scripts directory and are required to be run from this directory as not as stated in [Building] as being run from the root.


= Visual Studio =
Visual Studio 2010 (vs10) is not supported currently by premake yet if you have vs10 installed and run {{{premake4 vs2010}}} this will generate a vs9 projects then use the update tool to convert to vs10. As vs10 adds files which have not been created directly by premake a specific clean operation has been added to the premake script, this is run via {{{premake4 cleanVS10}}} Scripts to build a local install, build and run unit test etc. have been added for vs10 in the script directory.
